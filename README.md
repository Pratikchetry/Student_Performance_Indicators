- **Physical Activity**: Weekly hours spent on physical activities.  
- **Presence of Learning Disabilities**: Identification of any learning disabilities.  
- **Parental Education Level**: Highest educational attainment of parents.  
- **Distance to School**: Proximity categorized as Near, Moderate, or Far.  
- **Gender**: The gender of the student.  
- **Final Exam Score**: The target variable for prediction.  

## üìä Data Collection  

Data is gathered from various educational institutions and platforms, encompassing both structured (e.g., databases, spreadsheets) and unstructured formats (e.g., surveys, feedback forms). This multi-faceted dataset captures the critical factors influencing student performance, providing a comprehensive view for analysis.

## ‚úÖ Data Quality Checks  

The following checks are implemented to ensure data integrity:

- **Missing Data**: Identify and handle missing values using techniques such as imputation (mean, median, mode) or deletion.  
- **Outlier Detection**: Utilize statistical methods (Z-score, IQR) to identify and address outliers that may skew analysis.  
- **Data Consistency**: Validate data formats, encoding (e.g., categorical vs. numerical), and consistency across datasets.  
- **Data Distribution**: Examine variable distributions using visualizations (e.g., histograms, density plots) to identify skewness and normalization needs.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

EDA is performed to understand key relationships and patterns within the data:

- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Visualize the correlation between features to identify significant relationships.  
- **Boxplots/Histograms**: Assess the distribution of variables across categories to identify trends and anomalies.  
- **Scatter Plots**: Explore relationships, such as study hours vs. exam scores or physical activity vs. academic performance, to identify patterns or correlations.

## üîß Data Pre-Processing  

Data pre-processing includes several crucial steps:

- **Handling Missing Data**: Employ statistical methods (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors imputation) or domain expertise to fill gaps.  
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical values into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.  
- **Normalization/Standardization**: Scale numeric features using Min-Max scaling or Z-score normalization for consistency across models.  
- **Feature Selection**: Utilize techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or feature importance from models (e.g., Random Forest) to identify the most impactful variables.

## ü§ñ Model Training  

Multiple machine learning models are utilized to predict student performance:

- **Linear Regression**: For modeling relationships between dependent and independent variables.  
- **Decision Trees**: For making predictions based on decision rules derived from feature values.  
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions for improved accuracy.  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: For classification tasks, maximizing the margin between different classes.  
- **XGBoost**: An efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting for classification and regression tasks.

**Performance Metrics** used for evaluation include:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.  
- **R-squared (R¬≤)**: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable predictable from the independent variables.  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Calculates the average absolute error between predictions and actual outcomes.

## üèÜ Model Selection  

After comparing model performance, the best model is selected based on predictive accuracy and generalizability. Techniques such as cross-validation and grid search are employed for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the final model's performance, ensuring robustness and reliability.
