# üìä Student Performance Indicator  
A comprehensive machine learning pipeline designed to predict student performance based on key factors like study habits, attendance, parental involvement, and more. The goal is to empower educators and policymakers to make data-driven decisions for enhancing student outcomes.

## üìù Problem Statement  
The objective of this project is to analyze and predict student exam performance based on several key factors, including:  

- Hours of study  
- Class attendance  
- Parental involvement  
- Availability of educational resources  
- Participation in extracurricular activities  
- Sleep habits  
- Previous exam scores  
- Motivation level  
- Access to the internet  
- Tutoring sessions  
- Family income level (Low, Medium, High)  
- Teacher quality (Low, Medium, High)  
- School type (Public, Private)  
- Peer influence (Positive, Neutral, Negative)  
- Physical activity (hours per week)  
- Learning disabilities (if any)  
- Parental education level  
- Distance to school (Near, Moderate, Far)  
- Gender  
- Final exam score  

## üìä Data Collection  
Data is collected from various educational institutions, comprising both structured and unstructured formats that capture the factors influencing student performance.

## ‚úÖ Data Quality Checks  
The following checks are conducted to ensure data reliability:

- **Missing Data**: Identification and handling of missing values.  
- **Outlier Detection**: Addressing outliers to mitigate skewness.  
- **Data Consistency**: Validating data formats and encoding.  
- **Data Distribution**: Examining variable distribution for skewness and normalization.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
EDA is performed to identify relationships and patterns within the data:

- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Visualizing relationships between variables.  
- **Boxplots/Histograms**: Analyzing distributions for factors such as parental involvement, school type, and income levels.  
- **Scatter Plots**: Investigating relationships like study hours vs. exam scores or physical activity vs. academic performance.

## üîß Data Pre-Processing  
Data pre-processing includes the following steps:

- **Handling Missing Data**: Imputing missing values using statistical methods or domain knowledge.  
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converting categorical variables into numerical formats (e.g., one-hot encoding).  
- **Normalization/Standardization**: Scaling numeric features for consistency across models.  
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most impactful variables through methods like correlation analysis or model feature importance.

## ü§ñ Model Training  
Several machine learning models are applied to predict student performance:

- Linear Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- XGBoost  

**Performance Metrics** used for evaluation include:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- R-squared (R¬≤)  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## üèÜ Model Selection  
After evaluating model performance, the best model is chosen based on its predictive accuracy and ability to generalize well. Hyperparameter tuning is also performed to enhance the final model's performance.

## üöÄ Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  

### Libraries  
- numpy  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn  
- xgboost
